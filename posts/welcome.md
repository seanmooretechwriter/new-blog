# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my simple, old-school blog! This is built with Eleventy, a fantastic static site generator that keeps things fast and minimal.

## Why Old-School?

In an age of bloated websites and endless JavaScript frameworks, there's something refreshing about going back to basics:

- **Fast loading times** - No unnecessary JavaScript or heavy frameworks
- **Clean, readable typography** - Focus on content, not flashy design
- **Accessible** - Works on any device, any browser
- **Sustainable** - Lower energy consumption and bandwidth usage

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- Web development and programming
- Minimalist design principles
- Performance optimization
- Simple tools and workflows

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the content!
