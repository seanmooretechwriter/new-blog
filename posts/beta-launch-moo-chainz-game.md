I feel like the functionality is finally at a place where the game can be viewed by others.

So, today I present **Moo Chainz - The Game**:

It's been a journey and a very interesting learning experience building the game with AI.

The next step is to open up the GitHub repo for public viewing. That should be available soon.

Until then, check out the game! Hopefully it will provide some entertainment, a laugh or two and bring back some nostalgia for any old school gamers out there.
