# The AI Code Chef blog is live!

Welcome to AI Code Chef! After years of cooking up code in various kitchens, I've finally launched this blog to share recipes, techniques, and stories from the world of AI-powered development.

## What's cooking here?

This isn't your typical tech blog. Think of it as a kitchen where we blend traditional programming wisdom with cutting-edge AI tools:

- **AI-assisted development** - Practical tips for working with Claude, GPT, and other coding assistants
- **Code recipes** - Step-by-step guides for common (and not-so-common) programming challenges
- **Tool reviews** - Testing the latest AI coding tools so you don't have to
- **Architecture discussions** - How AI is changing the way we design and build software

## The philosophy

Just like a great chef knows when to use a knife versus a food processor, the best developers know when to lean on AI and when to code from scratch. We're not here to replace human creativity - we're here to amplify it.

## What's next?

I'll be sharing real-world examples of AI-assisted development, from quick scripts to complex architectures. Expect honest takes on what works, what doesn't, and what's coming next in this rapidly evolving space.

Ready to start cooking? Let's build something amazing together.
